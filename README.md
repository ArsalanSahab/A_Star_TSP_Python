# A_Star_TSP_Python
Implementation of A* Search in Python to find Shortest Path in a Graph For the Travelling Sales Man Problem



## Note : Must have Python 3.x installed and Added to Path 


### Instructions to Run :

    1. Clone this repository on your machine.
    2. Navigate to the downloaded repo through commandprompt/terminal.
    3. type : ` py -3 a_star_tsp.py `


### Working :

    1. Graph is created with users input.
    2. First Shortest Path is calculated.
    3. A Star applied using heirsitcs ; f(x) = f(g) + f(h).
    4. f(x) : A * Value , f(g) : Distance From Start Node to This Node , f(h) : Distance to Goal Node From This Node.
